# Nertz

This project is an experiment to build a computer system to play the card game [Nertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nertz). The system is a practice in machine learning, as the computer evolves in a sort of genetic algorithm over a large set of iterations. The end goal of this program is to determine optimal playing strategies for real-life gameplay, which modifies the available forms the automated players can take.

**Project Dates:** August 2019 - present
